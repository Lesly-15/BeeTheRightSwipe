Choose the path of a girl using a dating app in this multiple endings story.


## About this project
This website was created just for fun. It started as a crazy idea during COVID-19 quarantine after have myself using Bumble app to create some connections with my neighbors. Afrter virtually meeting a man who is dedicated to marketing and learning about "the heroes journey" with him and after quarantine has been extended in my country, I decided to start this project and thought would be cool to try and send it to the Bumble marketing team, because people is still in need of connections and maybe having fun reading the story and pretending they are the starring.

Bumble, such as almost everything, works based on decisions; this website does it too, literally. This pretends to be a "path-book" with multiple endings depending on the decisions of the reader.
